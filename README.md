# Amazon-UI-Automation
End to End User Interface Automation of Amazon. 


Code in this Repository represents a complete deployable User Interface Framework based on Selenium web driver, javascrit bindings.
But Why using Javascript language to implement this framework you might ask, It is because Javascript is Fluid, faster to implement, typeless and asynchronous(ability to run multiple scripts concurrently).
